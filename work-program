# Industry Standards Special Interest Group
## Work Program

## Goals
The goals of this industry standards group are:
- To support standards bodies to make full use of OpenAPI standards and specifications to support the growth of their ecosystems
- To understand what value standards bodies would need to gain from the OpenAPI Initiative to warrant becoming a member 
- To incorporate the ideas and needs of industry standards bodies into future work of OpenAPI, where possible

## Process
At present, we have broad agreemnt amongst working group members to focus on the following activities:
- To create a survey/discussion guide we can use with industry standards bodies to better understand their needs
- To create a case study template so that we can document the benefits that industry standards groups have generated from using OpenAPI standards and specifications to support their members and standards users
- To create case studies or other content that describes the exepriences of industry standards groups

## Timeline
We have decided to try and work on this industry standards group and work program until end of June 2025, and to share our findings on how work with industry standards bodies could continue to grow as part of the OpenAPI Initiative.
