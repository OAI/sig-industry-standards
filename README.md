# sig-industry-standards
Welcome to the OpenAPI Special Interest Group repo on Industry standards bodies.

Across a wide range of sectors, industry associations and other bodies are creating API standards that define how best practice APIs should be created for their industry sector.

OpenAPI is being identified in a number of ways in these standards:
- The standards may include specific clauses that note that standardised APIs being created should include an OpenAPI Description (OAD) file that uses the OpenAPI Specificatioon to describe the API.
- The standards body may also include OpenAPI Description files (OADs) for example APIs or for their own APIs.

This Special Interest Group has been created to support industry standards bodies to leverage OpenAPI as a way to help them grow their ecosystem and to speed up creation of standards-comnpliant APIs in their industry sector.

## Participating in the Industry Standards Special Interest Group
You can:
- Share your thoughts on OpenAPI Slack and and join the #sig-industry-standards channel
- Attend our biweekly meetings, contact us on Slack to confirm the next meeting date

## If you work with an in dustry standards body...
We would like to discuss how to support your adoption of the OpenAPI Specification in your standards and as a mechanism to help you grow your ecosystem.

We have a short survey you can complete to hel;p us understand your priorities for using OpenAPI and what would make it easier for you.

We would also like to share examples from industry bodies: we can write case studies, bl;og posts and interviews sharing your OpenAPI successes.
