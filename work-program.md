# Industry Standards Special Interest Group
## Work Program

## Goals
The goals of this industry standards group are:
- To encourage standards bodies to make full use of OpenAPI standards and specifications to support the growth of their ecosystems
- To understand what value standards bodies would need to gain from the OpenAPI Initiative to warrant becoming a member 
- To incorporate the ideas and needs of industry standards bodies into future work of OpenAPI, where possible

## Process
At present, we have broad agreement amongst working group members to focus on the following activities:
- To create a survey/discussion guide we can use with industry standards bodies to better understand their needs (COMPLETED)
- To create a case study template so that we can document the benefits that industry standards groups have generated from using OpenAPI standards and specifications to support their members and standards users (COMPLETED: [available here](https://github.com/OAI/sig-industry-standards/blob/main/case-study-template.md))
- To create case studies or other content that describes the exepriences of industry standards groups

## Timeline
**November 2025:** Create a sample case study sharing the value generated for one standards body<br>
**November 2025:** Reach out to 3 standards bodies to seek an opportunity to interview them for drafting of a case study<br>
**December 2025:** Share the sample case study at apidays in the OpenAPI track<br>
**December 2025:** Aim to meet with other standards bodies attending apidays and discuss participation in the SIG or how to be interviewed for future case studies<br>
