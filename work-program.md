# Industry Standards Special Interest Group
## Work Program

## Goals
The goals of this industry standards group are:
- To encourage standards bodies to make full use of OpenAPI standards and specifications to support the growth of their ecosystems
- To understand what value standards bodies would need to gain from the OpenAPI Initiative to warrant becoming a member 
- To incorporate the ideas and needs of industry standards bodies into future work of OpenAPI, where possible

## Process
At present, we have broad agreement amongst working group members to focus on the following activities:
- To create a survey/discussion guide we can use with industry standards bodies to better understand their needs
- To create a case study template so that we can document the benefits that industry standards groups have generated from using OpenAPI standards and specifications to support their members and standards users
- To create case studies or other content that describes the exepriences of industry standards groups

## Timeline
November 2025: Create a sample case study sharing the value generated for one standards body
November 2025: Reach out to 3 standards bodies to seek an opportunity to interview them for drafting of a case study
December 2025: Share the sample case study at apidays in the OpenAPI track
December 2025: Aim to meet with other standards bodies aiming to attend apidays and discuss
